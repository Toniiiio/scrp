# models
fasttext, xgboost, svm, bert, xlnet

fasttext was tried - did not work well. Makes sense since, it is not about complete sentences on web pages.
xgboost is more word based - which could be a better alternative



# features

1) could have up to date target texts from a job search machine
2) could have a classifier, like from xgboost
3) has 10, 25, 50, 100 elements on each page
4) has reucurring words like, developer, manager, leiter, etc.
5) could be within a table
6) could have links
7) could have multi page

1) they could be spread across multiple pages
3) That could be the match for other pages as well
6) that is only an add-on feature if i have spotted potential target texts
